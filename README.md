Library with implementations of different reinforcement learning algorithms

The algorithms that are on my todo list are:
* __Deep Q learning (implemented with target network and experience replay)__
* Simulated annealing
* Genetic algorithm
* TRPO (trust region policy optimization)
* CEM (cross-entropy method)
* Advantage learning
